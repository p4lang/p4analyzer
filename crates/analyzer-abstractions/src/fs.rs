	// a requirement to be `Sync`. See the following issue:
	//
	// https://github.com/dtolnay/async-trait/issues/77
	//
	// In the future, we should look at possibly implementing our own as part of `analyzer-abstractions`. In the
	// meantime, this trait and its implementations will explicitly return boxed futures rather than be made
	// `async`.
