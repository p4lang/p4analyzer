# P4 Analyzer
A [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) (LSP) compliant analyzer for the P4 language.

The analyzer is provided standalone (for integration with LSP clients supported in tools such as VIM and EMacs), or as
an extension for Visual Studio Code that uses an in-built WebAssembly version of the analyzer. The Visual Studio Code
extension can also be configured to use the standalone analyzer if required.

Both the standalone and WebAssembly based analyzer is built from the same code and aims to support all LSP features,
including:

* Code Completion
* Find References
* Variable Information
* Diagnostics
* Jump to Definition
* Hover

## Building the P4 Analyzer
To begin, you will requrie the following prerequisites:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  
If using `rustup` then the version configured in the root `rust-toolchain.toml` file will be installed.

* [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Building using Nx
This repository uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/) as a build system. Once the above prerequisites have been installed, run the
following commands. This will install the required Node.js modules, build the Rust and TypeScript projects, and finally
produce a `'.vsix'` package that can be installed into Visual Studio Code.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run package
```
> **â„¹ Note**  
The repository can be built on both Linux and Windows platforms.
